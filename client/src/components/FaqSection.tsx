    question: "How far in advance should I book?",
    answer: "We recommend booking at least 4-6 weeks in advance for smaller events and 2-3 months for larger events or peak season dates (May-September and December). For last-minute bookings, please contact us directly to check availability."
  },
  {
    question: "Is there a minimum guest count?",

  {
    question: "Can you create custom cocktails for my event?",
    answer: "Absolutely! Custom cocktail creation is one of our specialties. We can design signature drinks based on your event theme, color scheme, flavor preferences, or personal story. This service is included in our Premium and Luxe packages, and available as an add-on for the Essential package."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you provide non-alcoholic options?",
    answer: "Yes, we offer sophisticated non-alcoholic cocktails (mocktails) that receive the same attention to detail as our alcoholic beverages. We believe all guests should enjoy a premium drink experience regardless of their preferences."
